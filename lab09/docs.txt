Just completed a 6.50 mi bike - Yay!
This photo is from my #commute to work ... Which is about a half mile away from my house. :)
Gorgeous sunset during my commute home.
Can't complain about a commute that includes seeing an Osprey on the bridge.
However I found some great acoustic neontrees playing on the new 98.7 station. Fun!
Stuck in traffic. All I want to do is get home and relax.
Wow. Guy in tweed suit, vest, dress cane, tortoiseshell glasses just sat down.
Near perfect riding weather this morning. Loving these mild winter mornings!
Best part of my 1.5 drive home is the scenery.
Early morning commute sucks.
Can't wait until my daily commute is 10 minutes and not 2.5 hours.
Your Long Commute May Be Hurting Your marriage.
I already pay a ridiculous amount in train fares, a rise is just not an option.
Best way to start my day.
Today's weather and commute.
